# Single-, Two-, and Multi-Compartmentental Models

Conducted research with the Jeanne Lab in the Department of Neuroscience at the Yale School of Medicine. This group seeks to understand how neural circuits implement behavioral algorithms. Constructed computational single compartment, two-compartment, and multicompartment action potential models for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that simulate experimental results. Studied the effects of ion channels on action potential responses, synaptic input, and the effects of A-current on temporal synaptic integration. Implemented using Python, MATLAB, and XOLOTL.
